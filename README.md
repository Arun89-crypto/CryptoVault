# CryptoVault

CryptoVault is a vault on blockchain in which we can deposit our funds and then we can withdraw them in exchange of the stable coins which we got in exchange of the amount we staked in the vault.

```

Time T1 (initial time) :
----------------------

User : 500 XYZ (2 STABLECOIN = 1 XYZ)

          $CRYPTO$
[USER] -------------> [Vault]
       <-------------
          $STABLECOIN$

User : 1000 STABLECOIN

Time T2 (after sometime) :
------------------------

User : 1000 STABLECOIN

          $CRYPTO$
[USER] <------------ [Vault]
       ------------>
